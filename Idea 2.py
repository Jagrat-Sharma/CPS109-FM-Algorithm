This is the second idea for the cps 109 project

The problem is that I am playing Football Manager using a small team which doesn't have a good scouting system and want
to find good players but lack the budget and resources. I need a system which looks at my team and my budget to find
better players than what i have on my team who are either comparatively cheap or on a free transfer while taking into
account the global reputation of my team.

 position
